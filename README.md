This project focuses on getting started with Python programming and understanding the basics of the language. You will learn how to use the Python interpreter, print text and variables, work with strings, and follow the official Python coding style using Pycodestyle.

## Author's Disclaimer

Welcome to the Python world! As you dive into Python programming, you'll discover that there are often multiple ways to achieve the same goal. Some tasks may have only one acceptable implementation, while others may offer various possibilities.

Python has a linter and style guide called PEP8 (now known as PyCode). However, at Holberton, we will start by following PEP8 as it is less strict compared to PyCode. If you encounter a warning while running PEP8, you can safely ignore it.

Enjoy your journey into the world of Python!

  - An Informal Introduction to Python (Read up until "3.1.2. Strings" included)
  - How To Use String Formatters in Python 3
- Pycodestyle - Style Guide for Python Code

## Learning Objectives


By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Use the Python interpreter effectively.
- Print text and variables using the `print` function.
- Understand and manipulate strings.
- Demonstrate understanding of indexing and slicing in Python.
- Follow the official Python coding style and check your code using Pycodestyle.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repository containing a description of the repository is mandatory.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of this project is mandatory.
- Your code should use Pycodestyle (version 2.7.*).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

## More Info

### Pycodestyle

Pycodestyle is the new standard for Python style code. It helps maintain consistency and readability in your code. Following Pycodestyle guidelines will make your code easier to understand and collaborate on with other developers.
