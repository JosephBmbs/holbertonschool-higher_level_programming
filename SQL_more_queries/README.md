## Description

Welcome to the "SQL - More Queries" project! In this project, you will dive deeper into SQL and learn various advanced querying techniques to work with databases effectively. You will gain a comprehensive understanding of creating new MySQL users, managing user privileges, using constraints, retrieving data from multiple tables, understanding subqueries, using JOIN and UNION, and much more.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain how to create a new MySQL user and grant permissions
- Manage privileges for a user to a database or table
- Understand the concepts of PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY
- Use NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints effectively
- Retrieve data from multiple tables in a single SQL query
- Work with subqueries to solve complex problems
- Master JOIN and UNION techniques to combine data from multiple sources
