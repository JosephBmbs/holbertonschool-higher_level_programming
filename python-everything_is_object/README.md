## Overview

This project focuses on understanding the concept of objects in Python and exploring the difference between immutable and mutable objects. It involves various tasks to deepen your knowledge of Python's object-oriented nature and how variables are treated and manipulated in different scenarios.

## Background

In Python, everything is an object. This means that every piece of data in Python is an instance of some class or type. Understanding the behavior of objects is crucial for effective Python programming. This project aims to explore various aspects of objects and their interactions in Python.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept of an object and its relation to classes and instances.
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable objects and understand how they behave differently.
- Understand the concept of references, aliases, and assignments in Python.
- Determine if two variables are identical or linked to the same object.
- Display the variable identifier (memory address) in the CPython implementation.
- Identify the built-in mutable and immutable types in Python.
- Recognize how Python passes variables to functions.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following components:

1. Python Scripts:
   - All Python scripts should be placed in the project's root directory.
   - The first line of each Python script should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
   - The scripts will be interpreted and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
   - Ensure that all files have a new line at the end.

2. README.md:
   - A README.md file is mandatory and should be placed at the root of the project folder.
   - The README should provide an overview of the project, its objectives, and a guide on how to run and use the code.
   - It should also contain information about the learning objectives and resources used.

3. pycodestyle:
   - The code should adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*) guidelines.
   - Use a code linter to ensure consistent and clean code.

4. .txt Answer Files:
   - All answers to tasks should be placed in separate .txt files.
   - Each answer should be a single line, without any shebang (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/python3`).
   - Ensure that all .txt files end with a new line.

## Resources

Before starting the tasks, read or watch the following resources:

- [9.10. Objects and values](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types)
- [9.11. Aliasing](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types)
- [Immutable vs mutable types](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8056130/immutable-vs-mutable-types)
- [Mutation (Only this chapter)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)
- [9.12. Cloning lists](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-clone-or-copy-a-list)
- [Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-clone-or-copy-a-list)

## Requirements

- All Python files should be executable.
- The project should use Python 3.8.5 and be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*) for consistent code style.
- All .txt files should have a single line of answer for each task, without any shebang.
- Ensure that all files end with a new line.

## Happy Learning!

Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of objects in Python! This project will deepen your understanding and prepare you to tackle Python-related questions in interviews. Remember to think deeply before testing examples and strive to understand the reasons behind your answers. Good luck!
