## Introduction

Welcome to the **Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary** project for Novice developers. In this project, we will explore advanced data structures in Python, focusing on Sets and Dictionaries. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of these data structures and how to use them effectively in your Python programs.

**Author**: Guillaume  
**Occupation**: Novice Python Developer

## Resources

To supplement your learning, we recommend reading or watching the following resources:
