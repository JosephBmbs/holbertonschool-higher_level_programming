## Background Context

This project emphasizes the practice of test-driven development (TDD) in Python. It advocates for writing comprehensive documentation and tests before writing the actual code. Additionally, the importance of considering edge cases is highlighted, and collaboration on test cases is encouraged.

### Important Notice on Intranet Checks for Python Projects

Starting from today:
- You should prioritize writing documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests before coding.
- The intranet checks for Python projects will not be released before their first deadline, allowing more focus on TDD and thorough consideration of all possible cases.
- Collaborating on test cases is highly recommended to ensure all edge cases are covered effectively.

## Resources

Read or watch:
- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://pymotw.com/3/doctest/)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lfv5tUGsn8)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain, without the help of Google:
- The awesomeness of Python programming.
- What an interactive test is and its significance.
- The importance of writing tests for ensuring code correctness and reliability.
- How to write Docstrings to create comprehensive tests and documentation.
- Writing clear and informative documentation for each module and function.
- Basic option flags to create effective tests.
- How to identify and handle edge cases in test scenarios.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*) for maintaining consistent coding style.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using wc.

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- All your test files should be inside a folder named `tests`.
- All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`).
- All your tests should be executed using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- All your modules should have detailed documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your functions should have comprehensive documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`).
- A documentation is not just a simple word; it’s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
- Collaboration on test cases is strongly encouraged to ensure all edge cases are covered effectively – The Checker is checking for tests!
