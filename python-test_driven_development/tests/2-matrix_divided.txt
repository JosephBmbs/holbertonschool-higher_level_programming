# Test cases for matrix_divided function

# Test case 1: Basic division
# Divide each element of the matrix by 2
input: [[4, 6], [8, 10]]
divisor: 2
expected output: [[2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0]]

# Test case 2: Division by 3
# Divide each element of the matrix by 3
input: [[1, 3, 6], [9, 12, 15], [18, 21, 24]]
divisor: 3
expected output: [[0.33, 1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [6.0, 7.0, 8.0]]

# Test case 3: Division by 5
# Divide each element of the matrix by 5
input: [[5.5, 10.5, 15.5], [20.5, 25.5, 30.5]]
divisor: 5
expected output: [[1.1, 2.1, 3.1], [4.1, 5.1, 6.1]]

# Test case 4: Division by 1
# Dividing by 1 should not change the matrix
input: [[2, 4], [6, 8]]
divisor: 1
expected output: [[2.0, 4.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

# Test case 5: Division by 0
# Division by zero should raise a ZeroDivisionError
input: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
divisor: 0
expected output: ZeroDivisionError

# Test case 6: Invalid matrix (not a list of lists)
# The input matrix should be a list of lists
input: [1, 2, 3]
divisor: 2
expected output: TypeError

# Test case 7: Invalid matrix (rows of different sizes)
# Each row of the matrix should have the same size
input: [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]
divisor: 2
expected output: TypeError

# Test case 8: Invalid divisor (not a number)
# The divisor should be a number (integer or float)
input: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
divisor: "invalid"
expected output: TypeError

# Test case 9: Invalid divisor (complex number)
# The divisor should be a real number (integer or float)
input: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
divisor: 2 + 3j
expected output: TypeError

# Test case 10: Empty matrix
# An empty matrix should return an empty matrix
input: []
divisor: 2
expected output: []
